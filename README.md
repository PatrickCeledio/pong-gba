# pong-gba

My first attempt at making a complete video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance
in C language. 

To run:
1) Go into "/c/dev/gba_dev/pong-gba" directory
2) Type and enter "make" to compile the .gba file
3) Run pong-gba.gba on your favorite GBA emulator

Issues:

If you are getting an error along the lines of "Bad file descriptor" whenever
you attempt to make the .gba file... be sure to exit out of your gba emulation
instance....
